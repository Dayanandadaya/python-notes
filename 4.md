# Global Variables
### Variables that are created outside of a function  are known as global variables.
### Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

## Example
### Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function

# x = "awesome"
# def myfunc():
#   print("Python is " + x)
# myfunc()

# Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable
# x = "awesome"
# def myfunc():
#   x = "fantastic"
#   print("Python is " + x)
# myfunc()
# print("Python is " + x)

## Complex
### Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

###Example

# x = 3+5j
# y = 5j
# z = -5j

# print(type(x)) #<class 'complex'>
# print(type(y)) #<class 'complex'>
# print(type(z)) #<class 'complex'>

##Strings
###Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
##Example
# print("Hello")
# print('Hello')

# Assign String to a Variable
# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

# Example

# a = "Hello"
# print(a)

# Multiline Strings
# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
# You can use three double quotes:

# a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
# consectetur adipiscing elit,
# sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
# ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
# print(a)

# a = input("Enter Language name:")
# print(" Welcome to",a,"Programming! ")

# Slicing
# You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
# Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

# Example
# Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

# b = "Hello, World!"
# # print(b[2:5])

# Slice From the Start
# By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
# Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):

# b = "Hello, World!"
# # print(b[:5])

# Slice To the End
# By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
# Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[2:])

# Negative Indexing
# Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
# Get the characters:

# From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
# To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[-5:-2])

# Replace String
# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.replace("H", "J"))
# Split String
# The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.

# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:

# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']

# String Methods
# Learn more about String Methods with our String Methods Reference

# String Concatenation
# To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

# Example
# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

# a = "Hello"
# b = "World"
# c = a + b
# print(c)

# To add a space between them, add a " ":

# a = "Hello"
# b = "World"
# c = a + " " + b
# print(c)

# String Format
# As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

# Example

# age = 36
# This will produce an error:
# txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
# print(txt)

# But we can combine strings and numbers by using f-strings or the format() method!
# F-Strings
# F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.
# To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.

# Example

# Create an f-string:

# age = 36
# txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
# print(txt)

# Placeholders and Modifiers
# A placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.

# Example
# Add a placeholder for the price variable:

# price = 59
# txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
# print(txt)

# A placeholder can include a modifier to format the value.
# A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:

# Example
# Display the price with 2 decimals:

# price = 59
# txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
# print(txt)

# A placeholder can contain Python code, like math operations:

# Example
# Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result:

# txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
# print(txt)

# Escape Character
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

# An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

# Example

# You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

# txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
# To fix this problem, use the escape character \":

# Example
# The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:

# txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings
